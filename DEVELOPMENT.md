Week 1: On the week of November 18th, our group finalized what we would be doing in the project, and updated our Project Goals. We decided that we will be implementing the Djikstra's and Landmark algorithms. We decided to use a reddit data that looks at the different subreddits that are hyperlinked to each other. We then decided to use the algorithsm to find the shortest path between 2 subreddits, using hyperlinks. 

Week 2: On the week of November 25th, our group started to set up the programs. We created the makefile and main data reader, and also submitted the team contract and project goals. We also set up a framework and started to research how we could implement the algorithms. We also moved the data loader into the Graph class. Also started development.md. 

Week 3: On the week of December the 2nd, we decided to use BFS over DFS. Out group moved the BFS traversal into the Graph class, and implemented the Djikstra algorithm. We also started to set up the Landmark algorithm on this week. We had issues with the efficiency and started working on Djikstra's to increase the efficiency of the algorithm. We also started to set up the video script and presentation to turn in. 

Week 4: On the week of December the 9th, we finished improving the Djikstra's and Landmark algorithms to run faster. We also implemented test cases to verify our algorithms success for BFS, and the 2 algorithms. We made sure everything was working properly and finished writing our video script and finishing the presentation. We also wrote the results.pdf file, finished the read.me, and recorded our presentation.
